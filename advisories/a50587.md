title: Technical Advisory 50587
summary: TRUNCATE prevents table renaming
toc: true
---

Publication date: June 29, 2020.

## Description

When executing a [`TRUNCATE`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/truncate.html) statement on table, CockroachDB creates a new table, with a new descriptor ID, copies the contents from the old table to the new table, and then [drops](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/drop-table.html) the old table. When the old table is dropped, a [drop job](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/online-schema-changes.html) is created to asynchronously clean up the table's data. In v19.2, v19.1, and prior versions, a job ID is assigned to the old table prior to copying its contents to the new table. This means that the new table descriptor will have a populated drop job ID. This drop job ID prevents the table from being [renamed](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/rename-table.html).

## Statement

This bug has been fixed in versions v19.1.11, v19.2.9, and v20.1.0. All users are encouraged to upgrade (see [Mitigation](#mitigation) below).

The public issue is tracked as [#50587](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/50587).

## Mitigation

Customers on [v19.1.0 - v19.1.10](../v19.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.html) and [v19.2.0 - v19.2.8](../v19.2/upgrade-cockroach-version.html) are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the next maintenance release containing the fix. Until a patch is released, the scenario can be avoided by delaying [`ALTER TABLE RENAME`](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v20.1/rename-table.html) statements for any table that was previously truncated.

Because CockroachDB v2.1 will reach [End of Life](../releases/release-support-policy.html#support-cycle) on July 1, 2020, no new maintenance release for v2.1 will be issued containing a fix for this bug. Affected deployments running v2.1 should be upgraded to at least the latest release of [v19.1](../v19.1/upgrade-cockroach-version.html).

## Impact

All CockroachDB v2.x and v19.x releases up to and including v19.1.10 and v19.2.8 are affected.
